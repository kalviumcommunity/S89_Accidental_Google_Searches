## Why This Project: 
I chose this project because it combines humor with full-stack development, making learning fun. Itâ€™s unique, engaging, and involves key backend concepts like authentication, database operations, and API handling. By building this, I will gain hands-on experience in user authentication, CRUD operations, API development, and database management while creating something that people can enjoy.
